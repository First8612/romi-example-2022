# Robot for 2022!

## FAQs

### What is this?

This is the git repository with code for a 2022 romi example. 

### What programming language are we using?

The language we will be using is **Java** (this is totally different from Javascript, if you have ever heard of that). It is an extremely common programing language that you can use to do almost anything - including control a robot. It is one of the most widely used computer languages in the world.

### What is "gradle"?

Gradle is what the java world uses to run tasks that the project needs - like building, deploying, etc. It will be our "runner" to do many different tasks.

### There is a lot here. Where do I start?

Everything starts in the `src/main/java/frc/robot/Main.java` file. That's where the robot first looks when it begins running, and we will connect into that to make it work. Programmers usually use the `src/` folder to store the code that they write, to keep it seprate from things like build scripts, tests, and documentation.

## Getting Started

These are the steps I went through to get going:

1. Installed the WPILib installer from here: https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html
2. Installed `git` from here: https://git-scm.com/downloads
3. Use a tool like GitHub UI to download this repository: https://desktop.github.com/
4. Run the FRC VS Code link that #1 creaed for you, and then open the repository you downloaded in step #3

## How do I use this?

I'm still figuring this out. I am reading through this guide to understand it. https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/vscode-overview/index.html
